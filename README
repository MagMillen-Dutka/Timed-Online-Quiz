# Web APIs Challenge (Timed quiz)
## Description

This project worked on using the skills learnt in JavaScript to be able to create basic level functionality for a website page - specifically the creation of a password generator with prompts used for the user to understand key criteria.

The index.html and style.css files were already created, but the website lacked the necessary functionality of JavaScript.

It follows the user story and acceptance criteria detailed below.
