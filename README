# Web APIs Challenge (Timed quiz)
## Description

The deployed site was created to combine the use of JavaScript and JQuery coding to create an interactive web page with a game associated to it.

The index.html and style.css files were taken from an open source template and modified to match the needs of the site.
The JavaScript was adapted from previous code I have written, and from anonymouse instructions on websites such as w3schools.com. 
The code was adapted, re-written or changed to create the functionality to match the below acceptance criteria.

It follows the user story and acceptance criteria detailed below.
